# Introduction

The EYCA API is build on GraphQL protocol (http://graphql.org/).

## Base URL

```
http://dev.eyca.org/api
```

The current url is currently used for development purposes and will be changed when the new website will be going live.

## Authentication

You will need an API Key to connect to the API.

_**Warning**: Keep your API key secret!_

## Example Query

To execute a simple query `{ hello }`.

```sh
curl -X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Api-Key: [your-api-key]" \
-d '{"query": "{ hello }"}' \
http://dev.eyca.org/api
```

Replace `[your-api-key]` with a valid key.

You should get result:

```json
{"data":{"hello":"Hello World"}}
```
